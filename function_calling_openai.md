Let me clarify how the function calling works with OpenAI's API:

1. When the LLM (on OpenAI's servers) processes your prompt, it doesn't actually execute your Python function. Instead:

   ```
   Your Code -> OpenAI API -> LLM decides to use function -> Response comes back -> LangChain executes the real function locally
   ```

Here's the detailed flow:

1. The LLM receives:
   - Your prompt
   - The function schema (name, parameters, descriptions)
   - But NOT the actual function code

2. If the LLM decides the function should be called, it responds with a structured JSON like:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "get_current_temperature",
     "arguments": {
       "latitude": 13,
       "longitude": 14
     }
   }
   ```

3. LangChain then:
   - Receives this response
   - Matches the function name
   - Executes your actual Python function locally with the provided arguments
   - The real API call to open-meteo.com happens on your machine/server

So in essence:
- The LLM only decides IF and HOW to call the function
- The actual function execution happens locally in your environment
- The OpenAI API never sees your actual function code or has access to your local resources

This is a security feature - OpenAI's models can't directly execute code on your machine. They can only suggest what function to call and with what parameters.

Would you like me to show you how to implement this step by step with a specific example?
